     <h2 style = "color:blue; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Description</h2>
     <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry — 
        you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

     <h3 style = "color:orangered; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ingredients</h3>   
     <ul>
        <li>Cream cheese: This satisfying spinach artichoke dip starts with a block of cream cheese.</li>

        <li> Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise lends creaminess and a welcome tangy flavor.</li>
            
         <li>  Cheeses: You'll need grated Parmesan, grated Romano, and shredded mozzarella</li>
            
        <li> Garlic: A clove of minced garlic takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
            
        <li> Spices and seasonings: The spinach artichoke dip is seasoned with dried basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper.</li>
            
        <li>   Artichoke hearts: Drain and chop one can of artichoke hearts.</li>
            
         <li> Spinach: Thawed and drained frozen spinach is perfect for this easy recipe.</li>
            
         
     </ul> 

     <h4 style = "color:green; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients (except for the mozzarella) together.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish. Top with cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the spinach artichoke dip in the preheated oven until bubbly.</li>
     </ol>
 
     <h5 style = "color:red; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tips</h5>
     <p>
         It's important that your cream cheese is softened before you start mixing the ingredients. Otherwise, it won't incorporate well.
        Mix everything together before you add the spinach and artichokes. You'll want to get the cream cheese mixture well-blended first so the veggies stay intact.
        Squeeze out as much moisture as you can before you add the spinach so the dip doesn't get runny.
        If you want to make spinach artichoke dip in advance, mix all the ingredients together — but don't bake it. Store it in the fridge for a day or two, then bake it right before serving.</p>
